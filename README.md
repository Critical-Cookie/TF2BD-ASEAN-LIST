# babyrage-and-friends
List and Rules for TF2BD (TF2 Bot Detector by pazerOP). Designed for Asian region bots not found in the other lists or rules such as the babyrage bots.

# Use cases
The WIP rules.babyrage.json is made for ONLY BOTS detection
so I can keep what's left of my Insanity rather than go through another hundred hashes of UUID's.

The playerlist.babyrage.json is made for BOTH BOTS AND VERIFIED BOT HOSTERS WITHIN THE BOT HOSTING COMMUNITY 
that are not found within the TF2 BD's official list

# Can I contribute?
At the moment I will be the only Author, 

as this pet project of mine is extremely new and for authenticity reasons. 
This way you will have only me and my hatred for bots to trust for the given material.

# Ok cool, how do I use this then?
Download the entire contents as a zip file via cicking the CODE dropdown.

Save any of the individual json files that you want to use 
within your TF2 Bot Detectors cfg folder, and don't change the file names.


Start up TF2 BD and the tool will take care of the rest

# I like your work, but I don't trust you'll keep it to just Bots and Bot Hosters only. What if you're a troll and start adding legit players? Or get hacked?
While either of those assumptions are next to impossible, 
if you don't like the live update feature in either projects, simply open them within a text editor
and remove the entire line that starts with...

"update_url"

(please don't just remove the URL, as update_url will attempt to look for a URL that's not there, not find it, and will not accept the list/ruleset into the tool)

# I found UUID's or Rules that are targetting legitimate players!
I am currently contactable for any reason via cookiecomplaints@whowho.anonaddy.me
