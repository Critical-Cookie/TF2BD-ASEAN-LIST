# babyrage-and-friends
List and Rules for TF2BD (TF2 Bot Detector by pazerOP). Designed for Asian region bots not found in the other lists or rules such as the babyrage bots.


## What are the use cases of either list or ruleset?

The WIP rules.babyrage.json is made for ONLY BOTS detection
so I can keep what's left of my Insanity rather than go through another hundred hashes of UUID's.

I recommend using BOTH at the same time for efficient Bot detection in South East Asian servers!

* Note: The playerlist.babyrage.json is made for BOTH BOTS AND VERIFIED BOT HOSTERS WITHIN THE BOT HOSTING COMMUNITY 
that are not found within the TF2 BD's official list


## Can I contribute?

At the moment I will be the only Author, as this pet project of mine is extremely new.
This is also done for authenticity and trust reasons. 

This way you will have only me and my hatred for bots to give your trust.

I will be allowing public contributions in the future for me and a set of trusted authors to filter through,
but as of now, I'd like this project and contributions to be maintained by just me.


* Note: Contributions can be suggested within our Discord group, however for security purposes the links aren't made public,
and I will only be inviting trusted individuals on a case-by-case basis



## Ok cool, how do I use this then?

You can download the entire contents as a zip file via clicking the CODE dropdown.
Save any of the individual json files that you want to use 
within your TF2 Bot Detectors cfg folder, and don't change the file names.
Start up TF2 BD and the tool will take care of the rest

## Hey, your Steam Name rules are broken in ruleset.babyrage.json!

As of now, 26th August 2021, only the latest Nightly build of TF2 Bot Detector supports Steam Name detection via Moebs excellent contribution, the current stable build cannot understand what "personaname_message_text" means, therefore it will discard it and leave the rule entry as null


## I like your work, but I don't trust you'll keep it to just Bots and Bot Hosters only. What if you're a troll and start adding legit players? Or get hacked?

While either of those assumptions are next to impossible, 

if you don't like the live update feature in either projects, simply open them within a text editor

and remove the entire line that starts with...

"update_url"

* Note: (please don't just remove the URL, as update_url will attempt to look for a URL that's not there, not find it, and will not accept the list/ruleset into the tool)

## Hey I found "x" Bots called "name" that isn't on your list, but found in Asian TF2 servers!

I'll look into these if they are common enough to be included into my list, but if these bots can already be found in either the TF2 BD's Official/Trusted Rulesets/Lists then I won't
include them in mine.

The purpose of my pet project is to include Asian Bots that are NOT within any of the official TF2 BD lists, for better Quality Of Life for asian TF2 BD users.
(Bots only found within Trusted may have an exception, since many TF2 BD users may only be using Official, and not Trusted, since Trusted must be manually downloaded)


## I found UUID's or Rules that are targetting legitimate players!
